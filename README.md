## Introduction
__0x42__ is an open-source 60% ortholinear keyboard PCB designed to fit the (_de facto_) standard 60% keyboard cases and use an ergo keycap set (1u alphas, with 1.5u modifiers and -optional- split 2u spacebars).

Heavily inspired by the [Boardwalk][boardwalk-url] (although the variety of supported layouts is much lower, see below), __0x42__ is based on an ARM (STM32) MCU with onboard USB-C connexion (or through a daughterboard), it allows the use of a rotary encoder and has a dedicated LED driver for in-switch backlight (single color).

## Features

 * MX-style switches
 * Generic 60% format
 * In-switch LED backlight using dedicated LED driver
 * Rotary encoder
 * __No__ RGB underglow
 * USB Type-C with ESD protection _or_ (unified) USB daughterboard
 * Powered by [QMK][qmk-url]

## Supported layouts

![0x42 layouts](doc/renders/layout.png "0x42 layouts")
_Blue_ keys show some possible combinations of spacebars, _Orange_ can be replaced by rotary encoder, _Green_ are vertical (ergodox-like) 1.5u modifiers, and _Red_ are optional for HHKB-like layout.

## Keyboard cases

Please note that due to the ortholinear layout, some mounting holes on the PCB had to be moved (the 2 in the center part of the PCB), and consequently will not align with the standoffs commonly found in 60% tray-mount cases.
Only the 4 outer mounting holes are available in such situation.
This nevertheless results in a good fixation, particularly if using a switch plate, and should not be an issue for most users.

Other mounting types should not be affected.
