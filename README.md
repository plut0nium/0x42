## Introduction
__0x42__ is an open-source 60% ortholinear keyboard PCB powered by a STM32 ARM MCU.

It is designed to fit the (_de facto_) standard 60% keyboard cases and use an ergo keycap set (1u alphas, with 1.5u modifiers and split 2u spacebars), similarly to the Boardwalk (although the numer of supported layouts is much lower, see below).

This PCB features USB-C with ESD protection, both onboard and through daughterboard, per-key LED backlight (single-color), and support for a rotary encoder.

## Features

 * MX-style switches
 * Generic 60% format
 * In-switch LED backlight using dedicated LED driver
 * Rotary encoder
 * __No__ RGB underglow
 * USB Type-C with ESD protection
 * Support for (unified) USB daughterboard
 * Powered by QMK
