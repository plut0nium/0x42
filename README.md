## Introduction
__0x42__ is an open-source 60% ortholinear keyboard PCB powered by a STM32 ARM MCU.

It is designed to fit the (_de facto_) standard 60% keyboard cases and use an ergo keycap set (1u alphas, with 1.5u modifiers and split 2u spacebars), similarly to the Boardwalk (although the numer of supported layouts is much lower, see below).

This PCB features USB-C with ESD protection, both onboard and through daughterboard, per-key LED backlight (single-color), and support for a rotary encoder.

## Features

 * MX-style switches
 * Generic 60% format
 * In-switch LED backlight using dedicated LED driver
 * Rotary encoder
 * __No__ RGB underglow
 * USB Type-C with ESD protection
 * Support for (unified) USB daughterboard
 * Powered by QMK

## Supported layouts

## Keyboard cases

Please note that due to the ortholinear layout, some mounting holes on the PCB had to be moved (the 2 in the center part of the PCB), and consequently will not align with the standoffs commonly found in 60% tray-mount cases.
Only the 4 outer mounting holes are available in such situation.
This nevertheless results in a good fixation, particularly if using a switch plate, and should not be an issue for most users.

Other mounting types should not be affected.
